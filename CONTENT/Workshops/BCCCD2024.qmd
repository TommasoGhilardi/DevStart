Hello hello!!! This page has been created to provide support and resources for the tutorial and we presented at BCCC 2024.

# What will you learn?

This worhsop will focus on using python to run and analyze an eye-tracking study.

We will focus on:

-   How to implement eye-tracking designs in Python

-   How to interact with an eye-tracker via Python

-   How to extract and visualize meaningful eye-tracking measures from the raw data

# What will you need?

## Software

In this tutorial, our primary tool will be Python!! We recommend installing it via [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/). Our interaction with Python will primarily be through the Spyder IDE. You\'re free to use any IDE of your choice, but if you\'d like to follow along more smoothly, we suggest checking out our guide on how to install both Miniconda and Spyder: [Getting started with Python](GettingStartedWithPython.qmd).

Besides Python, we\'ll also be utilizing Psychopy! Psychopy is an awesome set of packages and functions designed for conducting psychological experiments. It\'s available as a standalone software or can be installed as a Python package.

Based on our experience, we find it more advantageous to use Psychopy as a Python package due to its increased flexibility. We provide this [anaconda environment](resources\psychopy.yml) to easily create an virtual environment with both python, psychopy and all the libraries that we will need.

## Stimuli

In our workshop we will also make use of some stimuli to create a cool experiment. If you want to follow along you can dowload the stimuli here:

# Q&A

This section is dedicated to the questions and answers that arise during the workshop. We will document the most pertinent and intriguing ones here for future reference and to assist anyone who might have similar queries.

**So... don\'t hesitate to ask a multitude of questions!!!**
