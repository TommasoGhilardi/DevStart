PsychoPy is an open-source software package written in the Python programming language primarily for use in neuroscience and experimental psychology research. It's one of our favorite ways to create experiments and we will use it through our tutorials.

So, let's start and install PsychoPy!!!

# Install PsychoPy

As reported on the PsychoPy [website](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html), there are multiple ways to install PsychoPy. Our favorite way to install it is using conda (refer to the [Getting started with python](GettingStartedWithPython.qmd)).

Psychopy offers a nice .yml file that will install a basic environment for running Psychopy. You can download the [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psychopy/psychopy/master/conda/psychopy-env.yml) from their website. 

We have also made a more complete environment, which contains Psychopy as well as Spyder (which is a python IDE) and tobii_research (which allows you to interact with an eye-tracker). You can download its [file](https://github.com/TommasoGhilardi/DevStart/blob/main/docs/psychopy.yml) from our github repository. 

Now open the Anaconda prompt.
Make sure to set the directory to where the .yml file is:

``` bash
cd C:\Users\ThisPC\Downloads
```

And then install the conda environment:

``` bash
conda env create -f  your_dowloaded_file.yml
```

This will take some time and will ask for confirmation but in the end you will have a nice virtual environment containing everything you need to run your experiment on PsychoPy.

The virtual environment will be called "psychopy" and you can activate it just by typing:

``` bash
conda activate psychopy
```

We are done!! You now should have a nice conda environment called "psychoPy" with PsychoPy in it. To launch the PsychoPy Gui (also referred to as Builder) you can just type `psychopy` in your Anaconda prompt and PsychoPy will launch. You are definitely free to try the Builder or the Coder that PsychoPy offers, however we usually prefer to write and launch our scripts from Spyder, let's be honest, if you want to code your experiment the Gui of Spyder is way better!!

Thus we suggest to install Spyder in your newly created "psychopy" environment. You can do that just by simply typing in:

``` bash
conda install â€“c anaconda spyder
```

You can also refer to our guide [InstallingSpyderide](GettingStartedWithPython.qmd#sec-installspyder).

Now that you should have both PsychoPy and Spyder installed. Next, we'll see how to create a simple experiment with them.
