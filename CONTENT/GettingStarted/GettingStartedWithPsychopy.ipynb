        "\n",
        "PsychoPy offers a nice .yml file that will install everything that we need. Download the [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psychopy/psychopy/master/conda/psychopy-env.yml) from their website and store it somewhere.\n",

        "```\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "We are done!! You now should have a nice conda environment called \"psychoPy\" with PsychoPy in it. To launch the PsychoPy Gui (also referred to as Builder) you can just type `psychopy` in your Anaconda prompt and PsychoPy will launch. You are definitely free to try the Builder or the Coder that PsychoPy offers, however we usually prefer to write and launch our scripts from Spyder, let's be honest, if you want to code your experiment the Gui of Spyder is way better!!\n",
        "\n",
