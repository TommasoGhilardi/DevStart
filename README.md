# DevStart 

DevStart is a repository created by three PostDoc researchers studying developmental science. We are interested in sharing our knowledge and experience on how to run experiments with different techniques, such as eyetracking, EEG, fNIRS, and more. Our repository aims to be a place to start acquiring practical knowledge on how to design and conduct experiments using open-access software.

## Why we are doing this repository

We believe that developmental science is a fascinating and important field of research, but it can also be challenging and complex. There are many different methods and tools available for studying various aspects of human development. Learning how to use these methods and tools can be daunting and time-consuming, especially for beginners or researchers who want to switch to a new technique.

We have been working in this field for several years, and we have learned a lot from our own trials and errors, as well as from the guidance and feedback of our mentors and peers. We want to share our insights and tips with other researchers who are interested in developmental science and help them overcome some of the common hurdles and difficulties that we have faced or seen others face.

We also want to promote the use of open-access software for conducting experiments, as we think that this can enhance the reproducibility, transparency, and accessibility of research in developmental science. We have been using various open-source tools for our own projects, such as Python, R, PsychoPy, Fieldtrip and more. We have found these tools to be very useful and powerful, but also sometimes tricky or confusing to set up or use. We want to provide clear and concise tutorials and examples on how to use these tools for different types of experiments.
